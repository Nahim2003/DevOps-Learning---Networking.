DNS and how name resolution works
Common networking tools like ping, traceroute, and netstat
Port management and firewalls
Troubleshooting connectivity and latency issues
The role of networking in CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure automation
🛠️ Tools & Commands Used

🙌 Final Thoughts

Networking is a core pillar of DevOps. Whether it's deploying applications, automating infrastructure, or monitoring system health—understanding how data flows is crucial. This module made that very clear.
